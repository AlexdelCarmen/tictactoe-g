# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. It was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. There are two players: X and O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.

To start playing, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Click on any empty cell on the board to place your symbol. The computer opponent will then make its move.

## Features
